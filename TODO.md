# TODO

- Fix pointers when loading from file

- Create world config json files and loader
- Create a menu in the window to change the parameters of the simulation
- Try to add a mass to the particles and change the collisions according to this + bounce on the walls
- Continue the README (+ explain how to import libs)
- Check for collisions between molecules
- Clear unnecessary includes, code, unused variables, etc.
- Do command line arguments to change some parameters of the simulation
- Bounce attribute for some particles : Manage bounces on the walls (because for the moment they just stop)
