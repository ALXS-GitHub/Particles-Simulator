# TODO

- Manage bounces on the walls (because for the moment they just stop)
- Try to add a mass to the particles and change the collisions according to this + bounce on the walls
- Continue the README (+ explain how to import libs)
- Make a functionality to drag particles with the mouse (left click)
- Check for collisions between molecules

## other

- keep the old particle rendering because it is more performant (but now i found a solution so the new rendering can render about 40000 particles at 60fps)
