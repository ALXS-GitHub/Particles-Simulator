# TODO


- Try hybrid parallelism (OpenMP + MPI)
- Try to make to imports more easy (with static files only)
- Manage bounces on the walls (because for the moment they just stop)
- Try to add a mass to the particles and change the collisions according to this
- Continue the README
- Try to use CUDA for the particles simulation
- Make some measurements to see the performance of the program with different parameters and methods
- fix the scroll

## other

- keep the old particle rendering because it is more performant (but now i found a solution so the new rendering can render about 40000 particles at 60fps)
