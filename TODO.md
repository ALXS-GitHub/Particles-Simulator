# TODO


- Make the grid layout for better performance
- Try to make to imports more easy (with static files only)
- Manage bounces on the walls (because for the moment they just stop)
- Try to add a mass to the particles and change the collisions according to this
- Try to use G++ instead of MSVC (and compare the performance)
- Continue the README
- Try hybrid parallelism (OpenMP + MPI)
- Try to use CUDA for the particles simulation

## other

- keep the old particle rendering because it is more performant
